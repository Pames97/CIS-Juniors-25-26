        <h1>My Favorite Anime: Dr. Stone</h1>
        <P>Dr. Stone is my favorite Anime Because after the world gets turned to stone after like 6 thousand something years the Main Character manages to break out of the stone and he uses science to try to bring the world back to where it was and get everyone else back to normal</P>
        <p>I first started watching Dr. Stone when I was trying to find something to watch and I just started watching it because I couldn't find anything else that looked good</p>
